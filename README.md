# Data-Structures:

### Arrays and Strings
* Arrays are collections of elements, while strings are sequences of characters.
* Important operations include indexing, slicing, reversing, and searching.

### Linked Lists
* Linked lists are linear data structures made up of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.
* Common operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Stacks
* Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
* They support push (insertion) and pop (removal) operations.

### Queues
* Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
* Common operations include enqueue (insertion) and dequeue (removal).

### Trees
* Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node, parent-child relationships, and leaf nodes.
* Binary trees have at most two children per node.

### Graphs
* Graphs represent connections between nodes (vertices) through edges.
* Graph traversal algorithms such as BFS & DFS.

### Hash Tables
* Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to values, providing constant-time average case lookup.
* They handle collisions using techniques like chaining or open addressing.
